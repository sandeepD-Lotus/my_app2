Streamlit ApplicationOverview:
 
This application is a Streamlit-based web interface designed to facilitate the inspection of porosity defects by querying and visualizing defect-related data. The application interacts with AWS services including Amazon S3 and DynamoDB to retrieve and display images, defect masks, and reports.
FeaturesSearch by Block Number: 
Input a block number to query the DynamoDB table and fetch relevant information.
Defect Visualization: Display localized defect images with an optional mask overlay.
Defect Report: View CSV-based defect reports if available.
Pass/Fail Status: Displays inspection status based on the presence of defect data.
PrerequisitesEnsure you have the following before running the application:
Python 3.8+
AWS credentials configured (with access to S3 and DynamoDB)
Required Python packages:
pip install streamlit pandas boto3 pillow streamlit-image-zoomAWS ConfigurationThe application uses the following AWS resources:
Amazon S3: Stores localized images, mask overlays, and defect reports in CSV format.
DynamoDB: Contains metadata and S3 file locations.
 
Environment VariablesEnsure your AWS credentials are properly configured through aws configure or environment variables.

Enter a block number in the search bar.
 
Click the "Search" button to fetch and display related data.
Inspect Defects
View the localized image of the defect.
 
Toggle the "Show Mask Overlay" to visualize the defect mask.
 
Check Inspection Status
"ðŸ”´ FAIL" is displayed if a defect report is found.
"ðŸŸ¢ PASS" if no defect report is available.
View CSV Report
Displays tabular data from the defect CSV if present.
